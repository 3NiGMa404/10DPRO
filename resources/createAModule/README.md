# createAModule

If you're feeling confident, one of the best ways you can hone your skills and help *us* at the same time is to create a module of your own!
That means coming up with an idea that would be an appropriate difficulty, and writing up instructions to help *others* create your program.

We write our instructions using a language called "Markdown" (including the instructions you're reading right now!).
To see how it's written, try clicking on `README.md` above and then the "Raw" button at the top right.

There are many guides out there on writing Markdown - this is a great place to start:

## Steps

1. Brainstorm program ideas that would be fun and suitably challenging.

    - Think about what programming is required - does it use if statements? Variables? Loops? External libraries?
    - If it's too challenging for Unit 2 (Coding Fundamentals), it might be more appropriate for Unit 3 (Programming).

2. When you've decided on a program, choose a name (something short and descriptive, like `magic8`) and make a new folder with that name.

    - The name should follow "camelCase" convention: starts with a lower-case letter, each new word is capitalised, and no spaces.

3. Then copy `template.md` into the folder and rename it to `README.md`.

    - The name is important - GitHub always looks for a `README.md` in each folder.

4. Use your favourite text editor to begin editing `README.md` - Change the title, description, steps, everything!

    - Try to find the right balance between too many instructions and not enough.

5. When you've created your instructions, it's time to contribute! Follow these steps:

    - If you haven't already, create an account on GitHub.
    - Go to our course GitHub page.
    - Click the "Fork" button at the top right (make sure you're logged in). This will copy our page to your account!
    - Navigate to the folder where you want to add your module (eg. `2_codingFundamentals/modules/`).
    - Press "Create new file" (top right).
    - In the "Name your file" box, type your project name, then a slash, then `README.md` (eg. `myIdea/README.md`).
    - Paste your instructions into the "Edit new file" box, and preview it (Preview tab) to make sure it looks right.
    - Add a "commit" message at the bottom (eg. "Add myIdea module"), then hit "Commit new file"
    - Finally! You should see an option to create a new "Pull Request". This will let you send your changes back to us.
    - Create the pull request, put in a brief message, and submit!
    - Watch for feedback - the teacher will likely ask you to make some changes before it's all accepted.

6. Phew! That's everything - thanks so much for contributing!
