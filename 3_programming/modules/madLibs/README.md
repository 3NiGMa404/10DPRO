# madLibs

A Mad Lib is a word game. The game prompts players to give random parts of speech or types of item (ex. noun, adjective, animal, food, colour, etc.), then uses the player's words to fill in the blanks of a story. The results usually range from silly to absurd. The story remains a secret until the words have been selected, so the player can't be influenced.

Your job is to create a Mad Lib game. Create your own story or find one to use.

#### Example:

```
    Enter a name: Elmo
    Enter a class at school: Big History
    Enter a professional: accountant
    Enter an adjective: wild
    Enter a place: airport
    Enter a length of time: 30 seconds
    Enter a thing: basketball
    Enter a person: Drake
    Enter a family member: cousin

    Please excuse Elmo from Big History today. His accountant says he is too wild to attend the airport. He will return to school in 30 seconds. Please send his basketball home with Drake, his sister.

    Signed, Elmo's cousin

```

## Steps

1. Start by creating a new file in IDLE. Save the new file as `madLibs.py` in your 10DPRO directory.

2. Prompt the user for the different words you would like, in order. Store them in a list.

3. Print the story with the users words added.

4. Use the resources below to guide you through the process.

## Extensions

- use a list for the types of blanks you want, and use a loop to ask for the inputs. (It will save you a lot of repeated code!)
- Create multiple stories with different names and required words. Let the user choose by title which game they'd like to play.
- Do something else creative!


## Assessment

| Level  | Expectations |
|--------|--------------|
| Bronze   | Gets user inputs, saves them in a list and prints the story. |
| Silver   | Uses a list and loop to ask for inputs. |
| Gold     | More than one story! |

- **Note:** all code should be commented and you should have no redundant code.
