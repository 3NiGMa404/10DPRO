This is one of the available options for your CAT 2 Coding component.

## Description

You will create a quiz on a topic of your choosing. 
- multiple choice questions, asking for A/B/C/D responses; or
- short-answer questions, comparing the input against the correct answer

Quizzes should let users know whether they got the answers correct, and display a score or other rating at the end.

## Extension

To further improve your project, you may want to:

- ask questions in a random order
- present multiple-choice answers in a random order
- improve short-answer detection by ignoring uppercase letters, articles ('the', 'a'), etc.
- in your code, combine questions and answers into a single "multi-dimensional" array
- randomly generate questions and compute the correct answers (e.g. for maths questions)
- save a high-score or leaderboard that persists when re-running the program
    - **Note:** this requires learning about File I/O
- show images with each question (e.g. a map for Geography, a cell diagram for Biology, etc.)
    - **Note:** this requires using the [Pillow module](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.x/installation.html#basic-installation) and [this method](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5333261/4080966) or similar
