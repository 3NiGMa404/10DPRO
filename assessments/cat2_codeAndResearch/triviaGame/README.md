This is one of the available options for your CAT 2 Coding component.

## Description

You will create a quiz on a topic of your choosing. You can use multiple-choice, short-answer or any type of answer format you like.

Quizzes should let users know whether they got the answers correct, and display a score or other rating at the end.

## Extension

To further improve your project, you may want to:

- ask questions in a random order
- present multiple-choice answers in a random order
- improve short-answer detection by ignoring uppercase letters, articles ('the', 'a'), etc.
- in your code, combine questions and answers into a single "multi-dimensional" array
- emulate your favourite game show's style of points/questions/gameplay
- incorporate difficulty settings and/or a timer
- accept multiple correct answers to a question (such as "List as many US states as you can.")
- save a high-score or leaderboard that persists when re-running the program
