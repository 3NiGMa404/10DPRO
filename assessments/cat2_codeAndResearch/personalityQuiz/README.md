# triviaQuiz

This is one of the available options for your CAT 2 Coding component.

## Description

You will create a personality type quiz that puts the user into a category based on their answers to questions.

Examples:
- Which emoji are you?
- Which Hogwarts house do you belong in?

Be creative with the types of questions you use, and use a calculation or comparison of some sort to assign the final result (it shouldn't be random).

The quiz should ask the series or questions, then output a final result based on the answers.

## Extension

To further improve your project, you may want to:

- ask questions in a random order
- present multiple-choice answers in a random order
- show images with results
